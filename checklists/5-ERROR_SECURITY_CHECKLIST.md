# SpeakEasyAI Error Handling & Security Checklist

This checklist covers all error handling and security-related items that need to be completed before deploying SpeakEasyAI to production.

## Error Handling

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for speech recognition API errors
  - [ ] "not-allowed" - microphone permission denied
  - [ ] "audio-capture" - no microphone available
  - [ ] "network" - service not available
  - [ ] "no-speech" - no speech detected
  - [ ] "aborted" - user or system canceled
  - [ ] "language-not-supported" - specified language unavailable
- [ ] Implement network error fallbacks for offline scenarios
  - [ ] Detect and handle offline state
  - [ ] Cache essential functionality where possible
- [ ] Add error monitoring with Sentry
  - [ ] Configure Sentry SDK with appropriate sampling
  - [ ] Set up alerts for critical errors
- [ ] Test application with network disabled
  - [ ] Provide appropriate feedback for offline state
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages for common issues
  - [ ] Use toast notifications for transient errors
  - [ ] Show inline errors for form validation
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
  - [ ] Add exponential backoff for API calls
  - [ ] Provide manual retry options for users
- [ ] Add logging for debugging speech recognition issues
  - [ ] Log recognition events, successes, and failures
  - [ ] Include diagnostic information in error reports

### Speech Analysis Error Handling Testing
- [ ] Test error handling in `analyzeFullSpeech`
  - [ ] Verify errors are properly logged and reported
  - [ ] Test with invalid inputs (empty string, negative duration)
  - [ ] Confirm error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Validate performance logging
  - [ ] Verify accurate timing information in console
  - [ ] Test logging overhead is minimal (<5ms)

## Security

- [ ] Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Run npm audit and address critical issues
  - [ ] Use npm-audit-resolver for managing exceptions
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy
  - [ ] Restrict to necessary sources only
  - [ ] Test with report-only mode before enforcing
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configuration
  - [ ] Limit to required origins only
  - [ ] Configure appropriate methods and headers
- [ ] Ensure secure authentication flows
  - [ ] Implement proper token handling
  - [ ] Set secure and HttpOnly cookie flags
- [ ] Protect API endpoints with proper authorization
  - [ ] Validate user permissions for each request
  - [ ] Rate limit sensitive operations
- [ ] Implement Supabase RLS policies for data protection
  - [ ] Test policies with different user scenarios
  - [ ] Verify row-level security in all tables
- [ ] Run security scanning tools
  - [ ] Static application security testing (SAST)
  - [ ] Software composition analysis (SCA)
- [ ] Test for common web vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Cross-site scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  - [ ] SQL injection (via Supabase)
