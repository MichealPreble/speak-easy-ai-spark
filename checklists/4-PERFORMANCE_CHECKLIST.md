# SpeakEasyAI Performance Optimization Checklist

This checklist covers all performance-related items that need to be completed before deploying SpeakEasyAI to production.

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Run production build and check bundle size (target < 1MB)
  - [ ] Identify and eliminate unused dependencies
  - [ ] Use dynamic imports for large components
- [ ] Implement code splitting for route-based components
  - [ ] Use React.lazy and Suspense for component loading
- [ ] Optimize speech analysis algorithms for mobile devices
  - [ ] Implement throttling for intensive calculations
  - [ ] Consider reduced precision on low-end devices
- [ ] Debounce real-time analysis calculations (500ms)
  - [ ] Implement in SpeechClarityFeedback component
  - [ ] Test on low-end devices to verify performance
- [ ] Implement caching for Supabase queries
  - [ ] Use React Query with appropriate staleTime
  - [ ] Cache frequently accessed user data
- [ ] Optimize audio processing for low-end devices
  - [ ] Reduce sample rate/precision when needed
  - [ ] Monitor CPU/memory usage during long recordings
- [ ] Run Lighthouse performance tests
  - [ ] Optimize First Contentful Paint (target < 1.8s)
  - [ ] Optimize Largest Contentful Paint (target < 2.5s)
  - [ ] Minimize Cumulative Layout Shift (target < 0.1)
- [ ] Target minimum score of 90+ for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO
  - [ ] Document any exceptions with justification

## Speech Analysis Performance Testing
- [ ] Benchmark `analyzeFullSpeech` function
  - [ ] Compare synchronous vs. async versions (target: async 20% faster)
  - [ ] Measure memory usage during analysis of 5-minute speeches
  - [ ] Test performance with and without logging enabled
  - [ ] Measure cache hit performance (target: 90% reduction in processing time)
  - [ ] Test cache size limits with 10+ unique speech samples
  - [ ] Profile memory usage with full cache vs. empty cache
- [ ] Validate parallel processing benefits
  - [ ] Compare parallel vs. sequential analysis with 10+ speech samples
  - [ ] Record CPU usage patterns during analysis
  - [ ] Test different detail levels of performance logging
  - [ ] Benchmark performance impact of detailed logging vs. basic logging
- [ ] Profile speech analysis in production build
  - [ ] Use Chrome DevTools to identify bottlenecks
  - [ ] Optimize any functions taking >100ms
  - [ ] Verify cache size is appropriate for typical usage patterns
  - [ ] Test edge cases: extremely long speeches (10+ minutes)
  - [ ] Measure impact of caching on battery consumption (mobile)
