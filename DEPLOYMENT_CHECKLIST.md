# SpeakEasyAI Deployment Checklist

This master checklist covers all items that need to be completed before deploying SpeakEasyAI to production. Each category links to a more detailed checklist.

## Overview

SpeakEasyAI is a web application designed to help users improve their public speaking skills through AI-powered feedback and analysis. This checklist ensures all necessary items are completed before deployment.

## Core Functionality

- [ ] All features from the [Feature Checklist](./checklists/1-FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md) have been implemented and tested
- [ ] All technical requirements from the [Technical Checklist](./checklists/2-TECHNICAL_CHECKLIST.md) have been met
- [ ] All compatibility requirements from the [Compatibility Checklist](./checklists/3-COMPATIBILITY_CHECKLIST.md) have been verified

## Performance and Security

- [ ] All performance optimizations from the [Performance Checklist](./checklists/4-PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md) have been applied
- [ ] All security measures from the [Error & Security Checklist](./checklists/5-ERROR_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md) have been implemented

## Compliance and Deployment

- [ ] All compliance requirements from the [Compliance Checklist](./checklists/6-COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md) have been addressed
- [ ] All deployment preparations from the [Deployment Checklist](./checklists/7-DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) have been completed
- [ ] All documentation from the [Documentation Checklist](./checklists/8-DOCUMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md) has been created

## Speech Analysis Module

The speech analysis module has been enhanced with new functionality including:

1. **Performance Logging**: Added ability to track execution time with configurable detail levels
2. **Async Support**: Parallel processing for improved performance
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error detection and reporting
4. **Analysis Caching**: Caching mechanism for frequently analyzed speech patterns
5. **Throttling Control**: Ability to limit analysis frequency for optimal performance

### Validation Tasks:

1. Test both sync and async versions of `analyzeFullSpeech` with:
   - Speeches of varying lengths (10s, 30s, 60s)
   - Different configuration options
   - Performance logging enabled at all detail levels
   - Repeated analyses to verify caching behavior
   
2. Verify error handling with:
   - Invalid inputs (empty strings, negative durations)
   - Edge cases (extremely long speeches, unusual patterns)
   - Network interruptions during analysis
   
3. Performance benchmarking:
   - Benchmark sync vs. async versions
   - Measure CPU and memory usage
   - Test on low-end devices
   - Verify caching improves repeat analysis performance
   - Measure throttling effectiveness during rapid input changes

See the [Feature Checklist](./checklists/1-FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md) and [Performance Checklist](./checklists/4-PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md) for detailed speech analysis validation tasks.
