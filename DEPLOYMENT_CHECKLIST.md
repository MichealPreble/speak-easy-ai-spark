## Speech Analysis Module - Key Validation Tasks

The speech analysis module has been enhanced with new functionality including:

1. **Performance Logging**: Added ability to track execution time
2. **Async Support**: Parallel processing for improved performance
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error detection and reporting

### Validation Tasks:

1. Test both sync and async versions of `analyzeFullSpeech` with:
   - Speeches of varying lengths (10s, 30s, 60s)
   - Different configuration options
   - Performance logging enabled
   
2. Verify error handling with:
   - Invalid inputs (empty strings, negative durations)
   - Incompatible audio formats
   - Processing failures
   
3. Compare performance:
   - Benchmark sync vs. async versions
   - Measure CPU and memory usage
   - Test on low-end devices

See the [Feature Checklist](./checklists/1-FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md) and [Performance Checklist](./checklists/4-PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md) for detailed speech analysis validation tasks.
